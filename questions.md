* What's the different between pull request and fetch?

>A Pull Request is specific to GitHub whereas push is a Git command that allows you to update a remote copy of your code online (GitHub). GitHub created Pull Requests so folks can collaborate together on proposed code changes. Folks can see what was changed in the code and discuss whether the changes should be merged.
